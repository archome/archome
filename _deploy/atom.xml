    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Masses are not defined by relation to production, but by their unpredictable and unregulated &#8220;circulation&#8221; (3). &#8220;Revolution is movement, but movement is not a revolution&#8221; (18); as a result the restriction of movement (through legislation, ghettoization, militarization and consumption) is the means by which revolution is suppressed. Revolution is therefore an &#8220;assault on time&#8221; and safety lies not in fleeing but attacking literally before your opponent has the opportunity to destroy you (22).</p>

<blockquote><p>Everything in this new warfare becomes a question of time won by man over the fatal projectiles toward which his path throws him. Speed is Time saved in the absolute sense of the word, since it becomes human Time directly torn from Death&#8230;</p></blockquote>


<p>The establishment of cities at places of strategic importance led to their fortification, a phenomenon which both implies and invites a constant state of siege (15). This state of siege has been expanded both horizontally and vertically to a state of emergency through the growth (and ownership) of the seas and airspace and the undetectability of attackers (38, 40). The vague and constant state of emergency described by Virilio is reminiscent of the paranoia and defensive actions resulting from the actions of collectives like Anonymous and Wikileaks.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hitler, like Napoleon, will be defeated by the _fleet in being_, which will constantly draw its victory from its inaccessibility to combat, from its abandonment of the harmful principle that we must attack as soon as the enemy is in sight, that we must shorten the distance between them and us. _The fleet in being is logistics taking strategy to its absolute point, as is the art of movement of unseen bodies_; it is the permanent presence in the sea of an invisible fleet able to strike no matter where and no matter when, annihilating the enemy&#8217;s will to power by creating a global zone of insecurity in which it will no longer be able to &#8220;decide&#8221; with certainty, to _want_&#8211;in other words, to win.</p></blockquote>


<p>Technology produces faster and more efficient machines, which in turn speed up the process of technological innovation. Peace is only achieved through the over-driving and collapse of this process (46).</p>

<blockquote><p>It is _speed_ as the nature of dromological progress that ruins progress; it is the permanance of the war of Time that creates total peace, _the peace of exhaustion_.</p></blockquote>


<p>Speed is the dividing line between East and West, North and South, and between those with hope and those without (47).</p>

<blockquote><p>With the realization of dromocratic-type progress, humanity will stop being diverse. It will tend to divide only into _hopeful populations_ (who are allowed the hope that they will reach, in the future, someday, the speed that they are accumulating, which will give them access to the possible&#8211;that is, to the project, the decision, the infinite: _speed is the hope of the West_) and _despairing populations_, blocked by the inferiority of their technological vehicles, living and subsisting in a finite world.</p></blockquote>


<p>Unsurprisingly, Virilio states that the natural outgrowth of a world system built on a hierarchy of speed is fascism (117).</p>

<p>The need for security has been manipulated into a form of consumption (122, 127). Since violence can be reduced to movement (40), security can therefore be defined as the absence of movement (125).</p>

<blockquote><p>We will see the creation of a common feeling of insecurity that will lead to a new kind of consumption, the consumption of protection; this latter will progressively come to the fore and become _the target of the whole merchandising system_&#8230;.The indivisible promotion of the need for security already composes a new composite portrait of the citizen&#8211;no longer the one who enriches the nation by consuming, but the one who invests first and foremost in security, manages his own protection as best he can, and finally pays more to consume less.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>The wandering physician became the medical doctor when he left commerce in drugs to the pharmacist and kept for himself the power to prescribe them. At that moment, he acquired a new kind of authority by uniting three roles in one person: the sapiental authority to advise, instruct and direct; the moral authority that makes its acceptance not just useful but obligatory; and the charismatic authority that allows the physician to appeal to some supreme interest of his clients that not only outranks conscience but sometimes even the &#8220;raison d&#8217;Ã©tat.&#8221; &#8230;</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>The difference between craftsman, liberal professional and the new technocrat can be clarified by comparing the typical reaction of people who neglect their respective advice. If you did not take the craftsman&#8217;s advice, you were a fool. If you did not take liberal counsel, society blamed you. Now the profession or government may be blamed when you escape from the care that your lawyer, teacher, surgeon or shrink has decided upon for you. Under the pretense of meeting needs better and on a more equitable basis, the service-professional has mutated into a crusading philanthropist. &#8230;</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Professionals claim a monopoly over the definition of deviance and the remedies needed. For example, lawyers assert that they alone have the competence and legal right to provide assistance in divorce. If you devise a kit for do-it-yourself divorce, you find yourself in a double bind: if you are not a lawyer, you are liable of practice without a license; if you are a member of the bar, you can be expelled for unprofessional behaviour &#8230; Morticians formed a profession, a dominant and disabling one, when they acquired the muscle to have police stop your burial if you are not embalmed and boxed by them. In any area where a human need can be imagined, these new disabling professions claim that they are the exclusive experts of the public good.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Skilled blue-collar workers were the bearers of a quite different culture. They were craftsmen who wielded complex skills (partly manual, partly intellectual) on which production processes were highly dependent and on which the income, status and power of the craftsmen, both in the workplace and in the household, rested. Consequently, their greatest preoccupation was the preservation of their monopolistic control over production know-how. This preoccupation identified their interests with those of self-employed craftsmen, made them suspicious of unskilled workers, and was a continuous source of antagonism towards the attempts of the capitalist employers to break the monopolistic practices of these craftsmen through deskilling innovations.</p></blockquote>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Notes on Wolfgang Ernst's "Media Archaeography"]]></title>
    <link href="http://archo.me/2012/02/26/media-archaeography/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-26T21:45:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://archo.me/2012/02/26/media-archaeography</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wolfgang Ernst&#8217;s (2011) presentation of &#8220;media archaeology&#8221; situates it as a methodological and aesthetic approach that is, in his description, preferable over &#8220;the supremacy of media-historical narratives.&#8221; In Ernst&#8217;s account, the media itself gains a certain level of agency:</p>

<p>{% blockquote %}
[Media archaeology &#8230;] is an awareness when media themselves, <em>not just humans anymore,</em> become active &#8220;archaeologists&#8221; of knowledge.
{% endblockquote %}</p>

<p>In the words of Parikka (2011): <em>it is the machine in which the past gets archived as a monument and that is the true subject of technical media culture.</em> Not only does media become its own archaeologist, in a sense media buries itself alive.</p>

<p>Ernst seems to suggest that media archaeology that focuses on the analysis epistemological relationships has a greater potential for subversive or oppositional discourse when media are understood as participating or belonging across other temporal spaces. Parikka (2011) argues, however, that Ernst has not leveraged this potential to its fullest extent.</p>

<p>Ernst&#8217;s media-archaelogical approach thus seems possible in part because its objects â artifacts â persist across time(s) and always have the possibility of being <em>reactivated</em>:</p>

<p>{% blockquote %}
The phonograph as media artifact not only culture cultural meanings like words and music but is at the same time an archive of cultural engineering by its very material fabricationâa kind of frozen media knowledge thatâin a media-archaelogical senseâis waiting to be unfrozen, liquified.
{% endblockquote %}</p>

<p>This &#8220;frozenness&#8221; of media also seems to concern its seeming indifference with the semantic content that it carries. Media operate at a level belowâor beyond?âconcern for the message interpretable by humans. For Parikka, this focus on the &#8220;micro-temporal&#8221; or &#8220;time-critical&#8221; is what distinguishes the German from the Anglo-American approaches to media archaeology.</p>

<p>Is it that media function at a level of granularity such that patterns are insignificant? Are the time-critical microÃ¶perations themselves so devoid of context that they are unintelligible? This can be compared with MacNeil&#8217;s (1995) distinction between archival description and metadata in the context of electronic records:</p>

<p>{% blockquote %}
Because the context revealed by metadata systems is so detailed, and the volume of transactions they capture so enormous, metadata may in fact obscure, rather than illuminate, the broader administrative context and thereby bias the users&#8217; understanding of the records&#8217; meaning.
{% endblockquote %}</p>

<p>This media-archaelogical approach may prove unsettling for some archivists for precisely this reason. Archives themselves become less &#8220;special&#8221; as they are transformed into registers or addressesâa <em>non-lieux</em> of Marc AugÃ©âthrough which we and media pass (cf. Trace&#8217;s (2011) adaptation of Feynman&#8217;s  file-clerk model of computing).</p>
