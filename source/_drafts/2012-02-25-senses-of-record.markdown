[Henttonen (2007)](http://acta.uta.fi/english/teos.php?id=10982) presents a continuum of senses of recordness based on deontic consequences of the speech acts within them:
 
```
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
Strong sense              Weaker sense                 Personal
  records                   records                     papers
```

Based on the supposition that record creation (i.e. in strong- and weak-sense records) is role-bound, Henttonen argues "personal papers generally need less contextual information than 'proper' records." This does not sit right with me. In time, I will reflect on why.
