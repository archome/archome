Masses are not defined by relation to production, but by their unpredictable and unregulated "circulation" (3). "Revolution is movement, but movement is not a revolution" (18); as a result the restriction of movement (through legislation, ghettoization, militarization and consumption) is the means by which revolution is suppressed. Revolution is therefore an "assault on time" and safety lies not in fleeing but attacking literally before your opponent has the opportunity to destroy you (22).

Everything in this new warfare becomes a question of time won by man over the fatal projectiles toward which his path throws him. Speed is Time saved in the absolute sense of the word, since it becomes human Time directly torn from Death...

The establishment of cities at places of strategic importance led to their fortification, a phenomenon which both implies and invites a constant state of siege (15). This state of siege has been expanded both horizontally and vertically to a state of emergency through the growth (and ownership) of the seas and airspace and the undetectability of attackers (38, 40). The vague and constant state of emergency described by Virilio is reminiscent of the paranoia and defensive actions resulting from the actions of collectives like Anonymous and Wikileaks.

Hitler, like Napoleon, will be defeated by the _fleet in being_, which will constantly draw its victory from its inaccessibility to combat, from its abandonment of the harmful principle that we must attack as soon as the enemy is in sight, that we must shorten the distance between them and us. _The fleet in being is logistics taking strategy to its absolute point, as is the art of movement of unseen bodies_; it is the permanent presence in the sea of an invisible fleet able to strike no matter where and no matter when, annihilating the enemy's will to power by creating a global zone of insecurity in which it will no longer be able to "decide" with certainty, to _want_--in other words, to win.
{% endblockquote %}

Technology produces faster and more efficient machines, which in turn speed up the process of technological innovation. Peace is only achieved through the over-driving and collapse of this process (46).

{% blockquote %}
It is _speed_ as the nature of dromological progress that ruins progress; it is the permanance of the war of Time that creates total peace, _the peace of exhaustion_.
{% endblockquote %}

Speed is the dividing line between East and West, North and South, and between those with hope and those without (47).

{% blockquote %}
With the realization of dromocratic-type progress, humanity will stop being diverse. It will tend to divide only into _hopeful populations_ (who are allowed the hope that they will reach, in the future, someday, the speed that they are accumulating, which will give them access to the possible--that is, to the project, the decision, the infinite: _speed is the hope of the West_) and _despairing populations_, blocked by the inferiority of their technological vehicles, living and subsisting in a finite world.
{% endblockquote %}

Unsurprisingly, Virilio states that the natural outgrowth of a world system built on a hierarchy of speed is fascism (117).

The need for security has been manipulated into a form of consumption (122, 127). Since violence can be reduced to movement (40), security can therefore be defined as the absence of movement (125).

{% blockquote %}
We will see the creation of a common feeling of insecurity that will lead to a new kind of consumption, the consumption of protection; this latter will progressively come to the fore and become _the target of the whole merchandising system_....The indivisible promotion of the need for security already composes a new composite portrait of the citizen--no longer the one who enriches the nation by consuming, but the one who invests first and foremost in security, manages his own protection as best he can, and finally pays more to consume less.
