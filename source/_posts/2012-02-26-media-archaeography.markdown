Wolfgang Ernst's (2011) presentation of "media archaeology" situates it as a methodological and aesthetic approach that is, in his description, preferable over "the supremacy of media-historical narratives." In Ernst's account, the media itself gains a certain level of agency:

{% blockquote %}
[Media archaeology ...] is an awareness when media themselves, *not just humans anymore,* become active "archaeologists" of knowledge.
{% endblockquote %}

In the words of Parikka (2011): _it is the machine in which the past gets archived as a monument and that is the true subject of technical media culture._ Not only does media become its own archaeologist, in a sense media buries itself alive.

Ernst seems to suggest that media archaeology that focuses on the analysis epistemological relationships has a greater potential for subversive or oppositional discourse when media are understood as participating or belonging across other temporal spaces. Parikka (2011) argues, however, that Ernst has not leveraged this potential to its fullest extent.

Ernst's media-archaelogical approach thus seems possible in part because its objects — artifacts — persist across time(s) and always have the possibility of being _reactivated_:

{% blockquote %}
The phonograph as media artifact not only culture cultural meanings like words and music but is at the same time an archive of cultural engineering by its very material fabrication—a kind of frozen media knowledge that—in a media-archaelogical sense—is waiting to be unfrozen, liquified.
{% endblockquote %}

This "frozenness" of media also seems to concern its seeming indifference with the semantic content that it carries. Media operate at a level below—or beyond?—concern for the message interpretable by humans. For Parikka, this focus on the "micro-temporal" or "time-critical" is what distinguishes the German from the Anglo-American approaches to media archaeology.

Is it that media function at a level of granularity such that patterns are insignificant? Are the time-critical microöperations themselves so devoid of context that they are unintelligible? This can be compared with MacNeil's (1995) distinction between archival description and metadata in the context of electronic records:

{% blockquote %}
Because the context revealed by metadata systems is so detailed, and the volume of transactions they capture so enormous, metadata may in fact obscure, rather than illuminate, the broader administrative context and thereby bias the users' understanding of the records' meaning.
{% endblockquote %}

This media-archaelogical approach may prove unsettling for some archivists for precisely this reason. Archives themselves become less "special" as they are transformed into registers or addresses—a _non-lieux_ of Marc Augé—through which we and media pass (cf. Trace's (2011) adaptation of Feynman's  file-clerk model of computing).
